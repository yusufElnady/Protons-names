# Protons-names

All you have to do is:
1- send any of us your username on git so we can add you as collaborators
2- add a function call at the end of the code so your name could be printed like ours (just write print_name("your name") at the end) 
3- save the file to the empty folder you cloned from the repo
4- add, commit, then push

That's it, have fun!
